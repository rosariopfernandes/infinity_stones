# Infinity Stones

Deletes 50% of the files in a directory.

## Getting Started

These instructions will put all the infinity stones in Thanos gauntlet and get him ready to snap.

### The Reality Stone is a prerequisite

Make sure you already have the reality stone before proceeding.
See [Ruby Installation](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)
 for details on how to acquire it.

### Do it at your own risk

To install all the infinity stones in your gauntlet, run:
```shell
gem install infinity_stones
``` 

Now you can tell Thanos to snap his fingers and balance your project:
```shell
cd my_unbalanced_project
thanos snap --with-gauntlet
```

**Note:** Please make sure you're on the right project directory. Thanos doesn't like balancing directories of projects
 that are already balanced and he takes no responsibility in that.

## Contributing

~Fun~ Collaboration isn't something one considers when balancing the universe. But contributions... do put a smile on
 my face.
